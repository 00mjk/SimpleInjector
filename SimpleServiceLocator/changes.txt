Version [Version Number] ([Friendly Version Number]) [Release Date]

Version vNext
	General description:
		This release fixes a small bug and adds a small feature to the core that allows the retrieval of
		IInstanceProvider types. The SimpleInjector.Extensions.dll builds upon this feature to improve 
		performance of the registrations made using the RegisterAll extension method. The extensions project
		also adds new RegisterManyForOpenGeneric that allow many more advanced scenario's.
	
	Code Changes:
		-Performance optimization for non-generic RegisterAll methods in Extensions library. The optimization
		 prevents the container.GetInstance method from being called on each service type in the collection,
		 but now directly calls into the IInstanceProducer interfaces.
		-Public Container.GetCurrentRegistrations() method added that returns a list of currently registered
		 IInstanceProducer instances. This allows visualizing the registered dependencies.
		-Public Container.GetRegistration(Type) method added 
		-IInstanceProducer has been made public to allow better performance optimizations in the Extensions
		 library and to give users the possibility see what types are registered.
		-New RegisterManyForOpenGeneric overloads added in the Extensions library that allow users to supply
		 a callback delegate that does the actual registration. This allows alternative scenario's such as 
		 registration of multiple implementations of a closed generic service type. (work item 15878).
		-The RegisterInitializer<T> method now allows multiple Action<T> delegates to be registered for a
		 single T. (work item 15842).

	Bug Fixes:
		-Container.GetService method failed on concrete unregistered types, that could not be resolved using
		 auto-wiring, such as System.String and System.Int32. (work item 15843).
